# Singing Trainer
A desktop application, written in Haskell, to aid in singing practice.
Includes the ability to play musical scales for warming up, and to play random notes in a given range to train pitch matching.

## Motivation
This project came about when I was first learning to sing.
My teacher would have me warm up my voice with scales, which he would play on his keyboard piano.
But when it came time to practice on my own, at home, I realised I had no piano, nor the skills to play scales without needing to think about it (and thus taking focus away from my singing technique).
So I wrote this program initially to play musical scales for me, to sing along with.
But over time I have added a few additional features, such as the ability to play a random note in a given range, to practice pitch matching.
